# Neptune Computational Biology - Final Project


# Tracking larva

## Introduction and Goals

The goal of my project is to automatically identify the number of flies in a video and estimate their speed.

The methods I will use to do this are:
* Static Background Fly Movie Format: is a video format that works well with background-substraction-based algorithms
* Background-substraction algorithms: to differentiate between the background and the flies.

I will use a video that is publicly available on Ctrax
