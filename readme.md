# Neptune Computational Biology - Final Project


# Tracking post its

## Introduction and Goals

The goal of my project is to automatically identify the post-its on my webcam and track them.

The methods I will use to do this are:
* The [program](https://github.com/davidpuga/neptune_final_project/blob/master/tracking.py) I'm using is based on [this](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/09/14/ball-tracking-with-opencv/) and [this](http://www.pyimagesearch.com/2015/09/21/opencv-track-object-movement/) program.
* I will use the following python packages: deque, numpy, argparse, imutils, cv2
* The scripts [range-detector](https://github.com/jrosebr1/imutils/blob/master/bin/range-detector) to obtain the HSV ranges for the orange post-it.

I will use my webcam.
