# Neptune Computational Biology - Final Project


# Tracking post its

## Introduction and Goals

The goal of my project is to automatically identify the post-its on my webcam and track them.

The methods I will use to do this are:
* I will use the following python packages: deque, numpy, argparse, imutils, cv2

I will use my webcam.
